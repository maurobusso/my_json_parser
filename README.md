# Json Parser

My take on [Write Your Own JSON Parser | Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json-parser/) by John Crickett using JS

## How the project works?

- This project is a script that checks whether an object is a valid "JSON" object or not.
- There are group of test folders that contain a set of valid and invalid objects, and the script will tell you which one is valid.

## How to run the project

- Clone the project
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

- Then run the command `npm test` in the terminal

## Resources used

Thisa are the main resources I have used to help me build the json parser.

- [Introduction to JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html/).
- [Parser Combinators: a Walkthrough](https://hasura.io/blog/parser-combinators-walkthrough/)
- [A gentle introduction to parser combinators - DEV Community](https://dev.to/yelouafi/a-gentle-introduction-to-parser-combinators-21a0)
